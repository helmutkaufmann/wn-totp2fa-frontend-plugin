## User Flow
1. Users access the login page and enter their username and password.
2. If 2FA is enabled, prompt the user for the TOTP code generated by their authenticator app.
3. Verify the TOTP code on the server side for security.
4. On successful verification, grant access to the user.

## Security Notes
- Always use HTTPS to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.
- Regenerate the secret key if the user suspects any compromise.
- Limit the number of attempts for TOTP verification to prevent brute-force attacks.

## Features
- Easy installation and setup.
- Compatible with standard authenticator apps (e.g., Google Authenticator, Authy).
- Configurable for multiple user accounts.
- Supports recovery codes in case the user loses access to their authenticator app.
